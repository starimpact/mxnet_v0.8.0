# Tutorials

The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions for creating models for specific types of applications.

They explain what each step accomplishes and why, and some include related information to enrich your understanding. Instead of procedures for creating your own model, some of the tutorials provide fully trained models or examples of models that you can use to create your own output.

## Example Applications

These tutorials cover use cases and applications of MXNet, organized by type and by language. To create your own applications, you can customize the commands provided.

# MXNet How To

The How-tos provide a range of information from installation, basic concepts and general guidance to demos complete with pre-trained models, instructions, and commands.


&nbsp;

The following topics explain basic concepts and provide procedures for specific tasks. Some include demos complete with pre-trained models.

## Setup and Installation
You can run MXNet on Amazon Linux, Ubuntu/Debian, OS X, and Windows operating systems. MXNet can also be run on Docker and on Cloud like AWS. MXNet currently supports the Python, R, Julia and Scala languages.

If you are running Python/R on Amazon Linux or Ubuntu, you can use Git Bash scripts to quickly install the MXNet libraries and all its dependencies.

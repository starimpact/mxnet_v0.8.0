# Read MXNet Code
- All of the module interfaces are listed in [include](../../include). The
  interfaces are heavily documented.
- Read the
  [Doxygen Version](http://mxnet.io/api/c++/index.html) of the
  document.
- Each module depends on other modules as defined in the header files in
  [include](../../include).
- Module implementation is in the  [src](../../src) folder.
- Source code sees only the file within its folder,
  [src/common](../../src/common) and [include](../../include).

Most modules are mostly self-contained, with interface dependency on the engine. 
You're free to pick the one you are interested in, and read that part.
